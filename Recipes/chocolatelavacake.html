    <p>Cheese calzones are an Italian classic. A calzone is a cheese stuffed pizza pocket (AKA folded pizza). Any toppings you like on pizza can be baked into these cheese calzones! Serve with homemade marinara.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-made pizza dough: â€“ buy good quality pre-made pizza dough in the grocery store or at your local pizzeria. If you prefer, you can make your own pizza dough from scratch!</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese </li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. honey</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>8 whole canned pineapple rings</li>
            <li>1 whole large red bell pepper, seeded and cut into rings</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Teriyaki sauce, as needed</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone cheesen</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>4 whole onion rolls</li>
            <li>1/2 whole red onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Green lettuce leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce, stir together the mayo, teriyaki sauce, honey, and cayenne. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Grill the pineapple and bell pepper rings over medium-high heat until they have great grill marks. (You can also just brown them in a hot skillet.)</li>
            <li>Season the ground beef and form it into 4 equal sized patties. Cook them over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes on the first side, then flip them over and add a splash of teriyaki sauce on top of each one. Place a slice of cheese on each patty and let it melt while the burger cooks through, about 4 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Butter a griddle or separate skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Spoon a little bit of the sauce on both sides and allow it to soak into the bread. Place the patties on the bottom buns and top each one with two pineapple slices, red onion slices, grilled bell pepper, and lettuce. Top with the top bun and smush it all together. Serve with extra sauce for dipping!</li>
        </ol>
